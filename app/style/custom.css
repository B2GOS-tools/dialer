/* XXX/drs: Here's a proposal. Any custom styles that we want accessible through
 * the on-device developer tools go here. The dev tools can automatically detect
 * this file, perhaps by file name. We can limit color and style changes to a
 * small subset of changes that are more practical to users, rather than
 * bombarding them with every single style. One problem with this is that web
 * components sandbox a lot of styles, but maybe we can figure out some way
 * around this.
